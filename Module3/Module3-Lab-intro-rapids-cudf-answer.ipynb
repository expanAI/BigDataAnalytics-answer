    "The RAPIDS data science framework is a GPU-empowered collection of libraries for executing end-to-end data science pipelines completely in the GPU. It is designed to make an effective use of the computational capabilities of GPUs with optimized NVIDIA CUDA® primitives and high-bandwidth GPU memory. The primary objective behind using RAPIDS is to accelerate individual parts of the typical data science workflow, and thereby accelerating the complete end-to-end workflow in Data Preparation and Machine Learning.\n",
